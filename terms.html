                            These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of

                        <p>
                            Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be 
                            considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held 
                            to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these 
                            Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement 
                            between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior

                        <p>
                            We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms 
                            at any time. If a revision is material we will provide at least 30 days' notice 
                            prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will 
                            be determined at our sole discretion.

                            effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree 
                            to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use the Service.
